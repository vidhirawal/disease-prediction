This Project is use to predict diseases, and the project is made in command-line-interface.

In this, we have used two algorithms "RandomForest" and "NaiveBayes" to predict the likelihood of the disease.

The project gives 95% accuracy for each module.

We have used two algorithms to check the disease condition is same or not.

We can use other algorithms as well, like KNN and other algorithms.

Here we have also used plots to check the condition more accurately and defined.
